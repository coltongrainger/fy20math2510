8. Statistics

A probability space (Ω, A, P) consists of a set Ω, a σ-algebra A and a probability measure
P. A σ-algebra is a collection of subset of Ω which contains the empty set and which is closed
under the operations of taking complements, countable unions and countable intersections. The
function P on A takes values in the interval [0, 1], satisfies P[Ω] = 1 and P[� A∈S A] = �

### exam policy

No make-up exams; please plan ahead.

## grades and assessments

Each of $\{i, r, p, q, a, b, c\}$ will be a real number scored from $0$ (empty) to $1$ (excellent), based on the assessment groups listed:

in-class participation | $i$
reading                | $r$
problem sets           | $s$
projects               | $p$
quizzes                | $q$
midterm A              | $a$
midterm B              | $b$
cumulative final       | $c$

Say that $\gamma$ is your uniform grade in the interval $[0,1]$. Then $\gamma$ has linear dependence on $7$ other random variables,

$$\gamma = \frac{i}{10} + \frac{r}{10} + \frac{p}{10} + \frac{q}{10} + \frac{3a}{20} + \frac{3b}{20} + \frac{3}{10}.$$

If $\gamma$ is "close" to (within $0.03$ lengths of) one of the real numbers $0.95$, $0.85$ or $0.75$, your letter grade will be $A$, $B$, or $C$. Else your letter grade will be marked with an appropriate $+$ or $-$ (if $\gamma$ is closer than $0.02$ lengths from $1$, $0.9$, or $0.8$, respectively).


### grading and revision policy

To be fair and predictable.

## grades and assessments

grading policy
: To be fair and predictable.

1. If $\gamma$ is "close" to (within $0.03$ lengths of) one of the real numbers $0.95$, $0.85$ or $0.75$, your course grade will be $A$, $B$, or $C$. Else your grade will be the appropriate $+$ or $-$ or withdrawal, etc.

2. Here $\gamma$ has linear dependence on $7$ other random variables,

$$\gamma = \frac{i}{10} + \frac{r}{10} + \frac{p}{10} + \frac{q}{10} + \frac{3a}{20} + \frac{3b}{20} + \frac{c}{5}.$$

3. (But, at least we have expectations!) Each of $\{i, r, p, q, a, b, c\}$ will be a real number scored from $0$ (empty) to $1$ (excellent), based on the assessment groups:

in-class participation | $i$
reading                | $r$
problem sets           | $s$
projects               | $p$
quizzes                | $q$
midterm A              | $a$
midterm B              | $b$
cumulative final       | $c$
